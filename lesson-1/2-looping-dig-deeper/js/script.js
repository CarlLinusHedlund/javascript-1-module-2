// JavaScript gives us several different
// statements and methods for repeating a process
// over and over or looping through arrays and nested objects.

// Common to all of them is we first specify under what conditions
// the loop or iteration should run in the statement declaration.
// e.g i <= 10 or i < 10 or i < arr.length (Number of elements in the array)

// And then we specify what should happen at each iteration in the
// body of the statement.
//
// Let's look at some of the most common
// and useful iteration statements for arrays and objects.


// I've set up an array called stuff that has some items
// in it and a nested object called nested objects.

// example we will do : We want to loop throw the array and the nested object
// and display them on the browser as we used to do

const stuff = ["piggy", "headlamp", "pen", "pencil", "eraser", "water bottle"];

const nestedObjects = {
    item01: {
        name: "piggy",
        type: "toy",
        weight: 30,
    },
    item02: {
        name: "headlamp",
        type: "equipment",
        weight: 120,
    },
    item03: {
        name: "pen",
        type: "tool",
        weight: 30,
    },
    item04: {
        name: "pencil",
        type: "tool",
        weight: 30,
    },
    item05: {
        name: "eraser",
        type: "tool",
        weight: 40,
    },
    item06: {
        name: "water bottle",
        type: "equipment",
        weight: 1300,
    },
};
